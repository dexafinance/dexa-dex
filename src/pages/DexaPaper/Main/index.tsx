          <StyledDesc>
            Hey #LUNAtics! Tired of monitoring price all day for trading in DEXs
            such as terraswap, astroport? We have your back. Introducing Dexa
            Finance - the DEX on Terra Blockchain that allows limit order. We
            are in final stage to publish beta version.
          </StyledDesc>
          <StyledDesc>
            Dexa Finance was made by an engineer turned product manager, who
            loves the Terra ecosystem and its stablecoin $UST concept. I'm also
            a frequent trader and have tried several trading platform, from CEXs
            such as Binance to various DEXs. While it is superior to keep UST in
            our own non-custodial wallet for security and also easy to put to
            Anchor Protocol to earn yield, when we want to buy or sell tokens it
            is not easy to buy or sell at a good price. Several times I had to
            transfer my LUNA or UST to CEXs to trade. Furthermore, being a
            product manager and working very closely with several product
            designers for several years, I think there are many opportunity to
            add value to DeFi in term of usability especially for non-tech.

            Alternatives for limit order on Terra
          </StyledSubTitle>
          <StyledDesc>
            The only option we have right now is Miaw Trader at
            https://miaw-trader.com I have used it for some times but found it
            still lack behind compared to experience on CEXs. Below are some
            limitation I find from community feedbacks
          </StyledDesc>
          <StyledDesc>
            1/ Limit order is only supported on #terraswap pools which has very
            high slippage due to its low liquidity. More pools should be added
            especially #astroport with low slippage
          </StyledDesc>
          <StyledDesc>
            2/ Having to pay fee in MIAW create a friction point. CEXs/DEXs
            usually allow to pay fee in trading pair in form of slippage fee or
            maker fee. How about being able to pay fee in $UST?
          </StyledDesc>
          <StyledDesc>
            3/ Lack of information on how it works and lack of audit for smart
            contract risks.

            As miaw-trader team seems inactive and have little maintainence and
            improvements, we have decided to step up to help Terra ecosystem
            grow even more. At initial stage, we have forked both limit order
            and web fronend from miaw-trader and make some important
            improvements. Kudos and really appreciate miaw-team for their work.
            If you are from miaw-trader team don't hesitate to contact us
            through twitter or discord for possible cooperation.
